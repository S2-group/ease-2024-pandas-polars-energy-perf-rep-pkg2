# Pandas vs Polars: A Comparison of Energy Efficiency and Performance

[Visit Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
[Visit Polars](https://www.pola.rs/)
--- 
> The purpose of this study is to compare and evaluate the two
 dataframe libraries Pandas and Polars in terms of energy efficiency.
Polars has published a benchmark against several other solutions claiming
it has better performance in terms of speed when running different 
SQL queries, especially compared to Pandas6. Additionally,
there exist other benchmarks comparing the performance of Pandas
and Polars using different queries which report similar results.
However, none of these benchmarks is systematic or peer-reviewed.
Predominantly we will look whether the improved performance
that has been reported by Polars, translates into energy efficiency.
Our contribution specifically studies the energy impact of using
Pandas and Polars in different scenarios like dataset size, operations
performed.
